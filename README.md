# browser-details
PHP script for detecting Your IP Address / Hostname, Browser/Computer Properties and Browser Headers.
(works with PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

# Note
Attempts to determine the capabilities of the user's browser, by looking up the browser's information in the browscap.ini file.
In order for this to work, your browscap configuration setting in php.ini must point to the correct location of the browscap.ini file on your system.
Browscap.ini is not bundled with PHP, but you may find an up-to-date file on http://browscap.org/. (Choose the php_browscap.ini file: this is a special version of browscap.ini for PHP users only!)
