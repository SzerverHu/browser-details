# browser-details
PHP script for detecting browser details
Attempts to determine the capabilities of the user's browser, by looking up the browser's information in the browscap.ini file. (works with PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

Note:
In order for this to work, your browscap configuration setting in php.ini must point to the correct location of the browscap.ini file on your system.
Browscap.ini is not bundled with PHP, but you may find an up-to-date file on http://browscap.org/.
